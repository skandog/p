        <P>
          My mother&apos;s family originates from Lebanon and I spent some time
          living there, in Beirut, when I was 19. Recently hit with a massive
          craving for the delicious falafel wraps I used to eat almost daily, I
          decided to do it from scratch.
          <br />
          <br />
          First step was to improve my pita game; previous attempts have been
          fine for dipping in hummus, but not ideal for a proper sandwich. I
          landed on{' '}
          <NextLink

          and the output was exactly what I was going for, soft and fluffy.
          <br /> <br />
          Then the key to the falafel was using dried chickpeas, rather than
          canned. Blending a bunch with garlic, spices and a load of herbs was
          straight forward. All that remained was to shape the patties and deep
          fry them. Best falafel I have had in years 😋 served with hummus,
          shreded cabbage and carrot.
